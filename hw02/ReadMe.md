1. hw2-1.py lights LEDs to buttons. Button pins: (20,21,22,23). LED pins: (24,25,26,27).
2. hw2-2.py uses buttons to control etch-a-sketch.  Button on 20 goes left, button on 21 goes right, button on 22 goes up, and button on 23 goes down.
3. hw2-toggle.py is the toggle program I used for the oscilliscope.
4. HW2.docx is the chart and data for the oscilliscope readings.
All buttons and LEDs all work properly.
