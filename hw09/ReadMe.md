![Blinking an LED](https://github.com/Briant717/ECE434/tree/master/hw09/pics/scope_0.png "Blinking an LED")
The waveform is very stable and has no Jitter.

![PWM Generator](https://github.com/Briant717/ECE434/tree/master/hw09/pics/scope_1.png "PWM Generator")
The waveform is stable, however there is a small amount of Jitter.

![Controlling the PWM Frequency](https://github.com/Briant717/ECE434/tree/master/hw09/pics/scope_2.png "Controlling the PWM Frequency")
The is no Jitter present in either of the four waveforms.

![Controlling the PWM Frequency Part 2](https://github.com/Briant717/ECE434/tree/master/hw09/pics/scope_3.png "Controlling the PWM Frequency Part 2")

![Loop Unrolling for Better Performance](https://github.com/Briant717/ECE434/tree/master/hw09/pics/scope_4.png "Loop Unrolling for Better Performance")

![Loop Unrolling for Better Performance part 2](https://github.com/Briant717/ECE434/tree/master/hw09/pics/scope_5.png "Loop Unrolling for Better Performance part 2")
Loop unrolling allows for a speed up about 6x as fast.

![Reading an Input at Regular Intervals](https://github.com/Briant717/ECE434/tree/master/hw09/pics/scope_7.png "Reading an Input at Regular Intervals")
The input and the output are about 44ns apart.
